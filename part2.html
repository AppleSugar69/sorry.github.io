        <p>Sorry, you know this word. Its a very strong word when you use it properly. So im gonna use that word properly and tell you my apology. See when you told me your story now i can understand you better now i can improve myself so be open with me say anything i dont mind at all. Dont think of it like i wouldnt get the joke or something like that remember one thing you might know some jokes but youre far below my level of jokes thats why i dont ever use them.</p>
