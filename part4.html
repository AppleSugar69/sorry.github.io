        <h1>Mistake</h1>
        <p>Not everyone is perfect. But im not everyone i wanna be perfect just so that i can see the smile on your face. We are human we make mistakes and we are suppose to learn from them but i say these words but then i make everything hastily i forget my own words that relationship is not suppose to be a race it about learning about your partner day after day. But i got annoyed when you would just say forget about it and wouldnt say me the whole thing or situation like im there for that reason too.</p>
