        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>In short i wanna say im sorry and i would try my best to be perfect. But i just want one thing that is you become open with me and dont lie to me. Remember that analogy of paper one i gave you well, shucks to be true but that analogy doesnt work on me no matter how many times this kinda situation pops up i will still be the same person and would have the same amount of trust i have at you before the whole situation. All i wanted was to comfort you and make you feel comfortable but i ended up making my fav person cry which made me sad, you were never the reason and never would be for my sadness. YOURE MY WORLD.</p>
        <p>I want you to know that i wont leave you cause im mr snow till death will be freezing.<br><br>愛してます,<br>[Kuro]</p>
